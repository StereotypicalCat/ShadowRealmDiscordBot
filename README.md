# ShadowRealmDiscordBot
A simple discord bot that plays a sound effect, and then moves a user to another channel in discord. Currently only handles 1 server at a time :)

# Usage
Find a soundclip to be played and put it in the root directory as audiofile.webm. Run the program by doing "node index.js <bot token>". Go into the channel you want a user to be moved to and write @setup <tag yourself>. Now, you can write !shadowrealm <tag someone>, and the sound clip will be played, along with the bot moving the user into another channel.
